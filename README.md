# Python Learning Labs 

My personal learning repository for Python. 

## Current Track: Python Concurrency & Parallelism

This includes:
- `threading`
- `multiprocessing`
- `concurrent.futures`

## Structure
Each folder inside `concurrency/` will be a self-contained day-wise lab/practice.

## Getting Started
```bash
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
```bash
python concurrency/day01_threads/main.py
```
